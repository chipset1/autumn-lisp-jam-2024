#+title: Readme

Starting point for the autumn lisp game jam 2024. I'm making a game in
clojurescript.

The features implemented before the jam are: basic player movement, image
loading and drawing, audio loading and playing, canvas resizing.

The dev instructions will be for emacs and cider since that's what I'm using. 
Will update the instruction to build the project later.

For development:
Run cider-jack-in-cljs and in the past I've had to run the commands below in the
repl to get it connected to the browser.
